##This is my first look at javascript
The problem to solve for this project was input verification.
I solved the problem by creating multiple empty arrays and depending on the users input and past inputs the values were stored into the proper arrays.

##Approach
psuedo-coding the steps of making a guess and considering the possiblity of user inputting the same letter multiple times allowed me to start on the right foot.
I knew I'd have to record every input but only react to certain ones so my initial structure supported the complete process for verification.
